title: Configure CD4PE
teaser: Set up all necessary integrations on a brand new CD4PE instance in order to
  prepare it for the configuration of your pipelines.
description: |-
  ## Introduction
  In order to work and automate Puppet code tests and deployments, CD4PE requires access to the APIs of Puppet Enterprise and your source control tool, so a list of prerequisite setups is needed before designing your workflows via CI/CD pipelines.

  In this lab you will configure the CD4PE integrations required to start to build your pipelines. You will:
   - Create a new user and a new workspace.
   - Configure integration with Puppet Enterprise.
   - Configure integration with source control.
   - Add a Job Hardware node.

  ## Prerequisites
  None

  ## Keep an eye on the clock

  The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, this lab should only take about **30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.

  When you're ready to begin, click **Start track**. When you've completed the lab, click **Stop** (appears at the top of this page after the lab starts).
