teaser: Create a user and assign them the default Viewer role.

  contents: |-
    In this lab, you will create a Puppet Enterprise (PE) user and assign them the default Viewer role (which has limited permissions) from the PE console.

    User roles are sets of permissions that you assign to users. In PE, you assign roles to users (or groups of users), rather than assigning specific permissions to individual users.

    Managing access based on roles ‚Äî or, role-based access ‚Äî is more efficient than managing user permissions on a per-user basis.

    Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.
