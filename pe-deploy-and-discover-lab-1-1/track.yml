title: Configure User Access
teaser: Learn how to assign role-based access in Puppet Enterprise.
description: |-
  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll learn how to manage users and roles in Puppet Enterprise (PE) so that you can control what tasks users can do within PE. Assigning users to roles — or role-based access control (RBAC) — is more efficient than managing permissions for individual users.

  **Prerequisites**

  None

  **Technical requirements**

  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.
