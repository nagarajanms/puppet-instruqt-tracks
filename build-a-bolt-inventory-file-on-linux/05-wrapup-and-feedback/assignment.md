In this lab, you:
 - Discovered how to create inventory files and assign targets to a group in an inventory file.
 - Learned why using groups saves time and simplifies commands.
 - Ran a command to list the targets in the inventory file to ensure the file was set up correctly.
 - Created a script to configure NTP on a server.
 - Ran the script against a group of targets defined in the inventory file.
 - Tested your knowledge to make sure you've got it down.
