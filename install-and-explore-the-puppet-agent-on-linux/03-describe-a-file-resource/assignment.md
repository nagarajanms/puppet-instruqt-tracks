# Step 1
Run the following command to create an empty file in the same path as in the previous challenge:

```
touch /tmp/test
```

✔️ **Result:** The system created an empty file named `test` at `/tmp`.

# Step 2
Run the `puppet resource` command to see how the file is represented in Puppet's resource syntax:

```
puppet resource file /tmp/test
```

✔️ **Result:** The output includes the file owner, when it was created, and when it was last modified.

## The content hash
The content parameter value might not be what you expected for an empty file. When the resource tool interprets a file, it converts the content into an SHA256 hash. Puppet uses this hash to compare the content of the file to what it expects.
