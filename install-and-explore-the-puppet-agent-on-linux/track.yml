title: Install and Explore the Puppet Agent on Linux
teaser: Install the Puppet agent on a fresh node and explore some of the tools that
  it provides.
description: |-
  In this track, you’ll use the command-line tools installed with the Puppet agent to interact with a node in the same way an agent would.

  **Why complete this track?**

  This hands-on approach will help you understand the agent's role in the broader Puppet architecture and how the agent checks and modifies the state of a node it’s installed on.

  **Technical requirements**
  For the best lab experience, use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari are not suitable for this lab — if you must use one of these browsers, see the [Lab Help Guide](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/practice-lab-help/) for workarounds.

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![30 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/30min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.
