title: Refactor the apache Web Server Profile
teaser: Use Hiera and class parameters to abstract the port value in the apache profile.
description: |+
  In this scenario, you'll configure nodes whose pp_datacenter fact is set to "dc-west" to serve web server applications on port 8080 instead of port 80, which is the port specified in the organization's default apache.pp profile.

  To do this, you'll use Hiera and class parameters to abstract the port value in the apache profile.


  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you will:

  - Run a PQL query to get the list of nodes in the dc-west data center.
  - Extend the apache profile by using a class parameter to abstract port information.
  - Test your changes by running Puppet against a specific node group.
  - Test your changes incrementally in a canary release. Within the subset of nodes in the canary release, you'll run Puppet in no-op mode and run it again normally.
  - Deploy code to the production environment.

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![30 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/30min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.
