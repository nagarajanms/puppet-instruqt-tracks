teaser: Add a deployment to a pipeline and then add a trigger based on a merge request
  from the main branch of the control repo.
notes:
- type: text
  contents: |-
    In this lab you will:
     - Add a deployment step to a pipeline and ensure deployments to nodes (including test nodes) use a best practice approach.
     - Add a trigger based on a merge request from the main branch of the control repo.

    Completing these steps will result in a workflow that deploys changes to test nodes after pull requests to the main branch from a feature branch are successful.

    Click **Start** when you're ready to begin.

Add a deployment to the Main pipeline for the control repo
========
1. On the **Windows Workstation** desktop, double-click the **CD4PE** shortcut.
    - If the browser window shows a connection privacy warning, bypass it by clicking **Advanced** > **Continue to cd4pe (unsafe)**.<br><br>
2. Log into CD4PE with username `puppet@puppet.com` and password `puppetlabs`.
    - If the browser isn't recognizing your keyboard input, copy and paste the username and password from these instructions.<br><br>
3. Navigate to **Control Repos** > **control-repo**.
4. Add a new deployment to the main pipeline. First, ensure **main** is selected in the drop-down menu. Then, click **Add Stage**:![add stage](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/add-stage.png)
1. In the modal that appears, enter the following for each field:

    <u>Create stage</u>
    - Stage Name: **Test Deployment**
    <u>Add to this stage</u>
    - Select Item: **Deployment**
    - Select a Puppet Enterprise Instance: **PE**
    - Select a Node Group: **Development**
    - Select a Deployment Policy: **Built-in deployment policies**
      - Choose **Direct deployment policy**
      - Leave existing settings as-is.<br><br>
1. Click **Add Stage** and then click **Done**.
5. Edit the **main** pipeline to include an Impact Analysis step for the **development** environment <i>before</i> the **deployment** step. First, click **Add Stage**.
1. In the modal that appears, enter the following for each field:

    <u>Create stage</u>
    - Stage Name: **IA for Test Deployment**
    <u>Add to this stage</u>
    - Select Item: **Impact Analaysis**
    <u>Select environments to analyze</u>
    - Leave as-is.
    - Click **Add Impact Analysis**, and then click **Done**.<br><br>

1. Click the ellipses (**...**) to the right of **IA for Test Deployment**, and then click **Reorder Pipeline**.
1. Click the blue arrows at the right to move **IA for Test Deployment** up the pipeline above **Test Deployment**. Click **Save changes** and then click **Done**.
1. Under the list of jobs, choose **Auto Promote**. (Do not select **Auto Promote** on the gate icon directly below **IA for Test Deployment**.) Your pipelines should now look like this: ![pipelines result](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/pipelines-lesson1.png)

‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** A deployment has been added to the main pipeline for the control repo. <br><br>

Create a new feature branch and use Gitlab to trigger the Main pipeline
========
1. From the **Start** menu, open **Visual Studio Code**.
1. Enable autosave so that you don't have to remember to save your changes. Click **File** > **Auto Save**.
1. Open the `C:\CODE` directory. Click **File** > **Open Folder**, navigate to the `C:\CODE` directory and click **Select Folder**.
1. If prompted to trust the code in this directory, click **Accept**.
1. In VS Code, open a terminal. Click **Terminal** > **New Terminal**. Change directory to `C:\CODE`.
1. Clone the **control-repo** project:
    ```
    git clone git@gitlab:puppet/control-repo.git
    ```
1. Change directory into the **control-repo**:
    ```
    cd control-repo
    ```
2. Check out the **feature_test_motd** branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b feature_test_motd
    ```
3. Navigate to the **data** directory (**control-repo** > **site-modules** > **role** > **manifests**).
4. Edit `common.yaml` to contain the following:
    ```
    # <control-repo>/data/common.yaml
    ---
    profile::base::login_message: 'Welcome to a new test server!'
    profile::apache::port: 80
    ```
5. In the VS Code terminal, add, commit, and push your changes to the `feature_test_motd` branch:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add server role to site.pp"
    git push origin feature_test_motd
    ```
6. Switch to the CD4PE browser window and review events for the regex pipeline on the control repo. If nothing is happening, click the **New Events** button: ![new events](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/new-events.png)

1. The pipeline event will show as pending until the jobs finish running (which takes 1-2 minutes). Click the drop-down arrow at the right for a detailed look at the jobs as they run:![jobs running](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/jobs-running.png)

‚úîÔ∏è **Result:**  Once the jobs finish running, the output shows that the **feature_server** branch has been added: ![regex events](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/regex-events.png)

Create a Gitlab merge request to run the Main pipeline
========
1. On the **Windows Workstation** desktop, double-click the **Gitlab** desktop icon.
1. Log in with username `puppet`and password `puppetlabs`.
2. Navigate to the `control-repo` project, and then click the **Merge Requests** icon located in the left navigation bar: ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/merge-requests2.png)

3. Click **Create merge request**, and then click **Change branches** (next to `production` in the header).
1. Leave **Source branch** set to the `feature_test_motd`.
1. For **Target branch**, choose `main`.
1. Click **Compare branches and continue**. This will create a merge request to merge `feature_test_motd` to `main`.
4. Leave the title as-is and click **Create merge request**.

‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** The `feature_test_motd` branch was merged to `main` using a Gitlab merge request. <br><br>

Inspect the development environment impact analysis and promote pipeline to Deploy
========
1. Return to the CD4PE browser window (which may be a tab of the Gitlab browser), scroll down, and click **New Events**.
3. Observe the `main` pipeline as it runs the unit tests and syntax checks, and then runs the Impact Analysis.
4. Once Impact Analysis finishes running, notice that the pipeline stops. It is waiting for a manual promotion to run the Deployment step.
5. Click to inspect the IA output: Click **6 Succeeded**, then click the blue **#1** analysis report: ![IA analysis #1](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/ia-done.png)

1. Click **View Analysis** and review the output shown.
6. Return to **Control Repos** > **control-repo** and then click **Promote** (to the right, under **IA for Test Deployment**). Click **Promote** and then click **Done**.
7. Click **New Events**, and then click the drop-down arrow to view the Deployment run progress.
8. Record the Job ID: Click on the green **#1 Succeeded**, then click the blue job report under **Deployment Done**. [ID note: unable to complete this step, can't locate the job report - steps beyond here need reviewed]
1. Navigate to **Deployment Steps** > **Orchestration Task** and click **View Jobs**. The job ID will be revealed.

    üîÄ Switch to the **PE Console** tab<br><br>
9. Log in to PE with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
1. Navigate to **Jobs**, and then click on the Job ID reported from CD4PE.
11. Review the changes to the nodes in the **Development** node group.

‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** tbd. <br><br>

--------
üéà **Congratulations!** In this lab you added a deployment step to the main pipeline for the control repo. You used Gitlab to trigger the Main pipeline. You then added a trigger based on a merge request from the main branch of the control repo. You also inspected the Impact Analysis of the jobs that you ran and promoted a pipeline to deply. This is a best-practice workflow for deploying changes to test nodes.
