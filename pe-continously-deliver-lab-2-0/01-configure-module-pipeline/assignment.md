    In this lab you will put together a basic pipeline built for module testing and gain a familiarity with building pipelines. You will:

     - Create a module pipeline.
     - Create breaking changes to unit and syntax tests in order to test your pipeline.
     - Fix the breaking changes and then run your pipeline successfully.

    Click **Start** when you are ready to begin.

Create a module pipeline
========

1. On the Windows Workstation desktop, double-click the CD4PE shortcut.
     - If the browser window shows a connection privacy warning, bypass it by clicking **Advanced** > **Continue to cd4pe (unsafe)**.<br><br>
1. Enter username `puppet@puppet.com` and password `puppetlabs`.
    - If the browser doesn't recognize your keyboard input, copy the username and password from these instructions.<br><br>
1. From the left navigation menu, navigate to **Code delivery** > **Modules**, and then click **Add module**.
1. For each field, enter the following:

    <u>Select a source</u>
      - Source: **Gitlab|puppet**
      - Repository: **module**
    <u>Select deployment branch</u>
      - Use this branch for deployments: **main**<br><br>

1. Assign the module a display name of **module**.
1. Click **Add Module**.
1. On the main Modules page, click the **Add Pipeline** icon:![add pipeline icon](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/Lab2.0-1-1.png)
1. In the modal pop-up, choose **Branch Regex**. In **Configure regex**, keep the default of `feature_.*`:![modal screenshot](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/Lab2.0-2-2.png)
1. Click **Add pipeline**, and then click **Done**. After returning to main modules page, observe that the branch name has changed to regex.![branch regex](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/Lab2.0-3-2.png)
1. Click **+Add default pipeline**.
‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** A pipeline is created.

Test your module pipeline
========

1. From the **Start** menu, open **Visual Studio Code**.<br><br>
    üí° **Tip:** Enable VS Code autosave by clicking **File** > **Auto Save**. By enabling autosave, you don't need to remember to save your changes as you work, ensuring your edits won't be lost.<br><br>

1. Open the `C:\CODE` directory. Click **File** > **Open Folder**, navigate to the `C:\CODE` directory, and click **Select Folder**.
1. In VS Code, open a terminal. Click **Terminal** > **New Terminal**.
1. In the VS Code terminal window, run the following command:
    ```
    git clone git@gitlab:puppet/module.git
    ```
1. Check out a new feature branch `feature_test` to use with the new regex pipeline:
    ```
    cd module
    git checkout -b feature_test
    ```
1. Using VS Code Explorer, open **nginx_spec.rb** (**Local Disk** > **module** > **spec** > **classes** > **nginx_spec.rb**) and remove line 13 to intentionally and temporarily break the unit tests to show the pipeline executing.
1. Using VS Code Explorer, open **init.pp** (**Local Disk** > **module** > **manifests** > **init.pp**) and remove the last line of the file to intentionally and temporarily break the syntax to show the pipeline executing.
1. Commit and push your code to your feature branch.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Force a pipeline run with failed code"
    git push origin feature_test
    ```

1. Navigate to the CD4PE window and observe pipeline job and failure output as it appears in the Events section at the bottom of the page. (You may need to refresh the CD4PE window to see the changes.) ![pipeline failure](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/PE501-Continuously%20Deliver/Lab2.0-4.png)

‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** The errors you intentionally added to the code have successfully (and temporarily!) broken the pipeline.

Fix the module repository code to run the pipeline successfully
========

1. Switch back to the VS Code window to fix unit and syntax tests. Open **nginx_spec.rb** and fix the code you broke earlier.
    - Not sure how to fix it? Copy the original code from [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/kmo-501-nginx/blob/production/spec/classes/nginx_spec.rb).
1. Open **init.pp** and fix the syntax bug you created earlier.
    - Not sure how to fix it? Copy the original code from [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/kmo-501-nginx/blob/production/manifests/init.pp).
1. In the VS Code terminal window, commit and push your code to your feature branch.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Force a pipeline run with failed code"
    git push
    ```
1. Switch back to the CD4PE browser window. (Refresh the window if needed.)
1. Observe pipeline unit test and syntax success.![]()

‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** You fixed the errors in the code and now the pipeline works as expected.

üéà **Congratulations!**

You created a module pipeline, intentionally broke the unit and syntax tests to show the pipeline executing, and then fixed your code to run the pipeline successfully. Click **Next** to close this lab.
