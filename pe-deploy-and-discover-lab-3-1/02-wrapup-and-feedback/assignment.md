In this lab, you learned how to enable the package data collection feature via the PE console to discover which packages are installed across your systems. Then, you used this information to identify the roles of the servers in your environment (web server, database server, and so on).

Want to try it out in your own environment? Visit the companion [Job Aid](https://puppet-kmo.gitbook.io/lab-aids/-MZKPjwKRKKFuXxxy7ge/pe101/identify-packages-and-server-roles-by-using-package-data-collection).
