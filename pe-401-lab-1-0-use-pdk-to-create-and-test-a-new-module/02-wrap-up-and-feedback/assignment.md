difficulty: basic
timelimit: 300

In this lab, you:
- Explored the current state of your test nodes and produced Puppet code that helped you to develop your module.
- Created, tested, and validated a new module and a new class by using **Puppet Development Kit (PDK)**.
- Used the Puppet code that you obtained to manage the resources for the NGINX package and service. Then, used PDK to validate the code's syntax and style before running a unit test to ensure your code compiled and functioned as expected.
