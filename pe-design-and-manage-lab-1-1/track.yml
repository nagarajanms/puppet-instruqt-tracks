title: Simulate Changes by Running in No-op Mode
teaser: Simulate a Puppet run to understand how Puppet remediates drift and keeps
  your systems in their desired state.
description: |-
  In this lab, you will simulate a Puppet run to understand how Puppet remediates drift and keeps your systems in their desired state. You will:


  - Cause drift by making a breaking change to a Puppet component (the `pxp-agent` or the uninstaller script).
  - Run Puppet with the `--noop` parameter to simulate a Puppet run without making changes to the system.
  - Run Puppet normally to fix the drift you caused.
