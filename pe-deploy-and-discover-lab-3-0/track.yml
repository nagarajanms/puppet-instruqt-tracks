title: Identify Your Nodes Using External Facts
teaser: You can use facts to help you write conditional expressions and reusable code.
description: |-
  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll run Facter to retrieve a core fact value. Then, you'll use that value to define a simple external fact that sets site-specific information about the node.

  Facts provide a foundation on which you can write conditional expressions and reusable code. Examples include:
  * Using facts in a file template to configure different versions of a file based on the fact values that the agents send to the primary server â€” such as creating a web server config file for each agent, where the server hostname setting is dynamically set to the hostname fact value sent by the agent.
  * Defining facts to use in PuppetDB queries or to provide the primary server with additional information for building the agent node's catalog.

  **Keep an eye on the clock**

  ![30 minute lab](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/Clocks%20for%20Track%20Duration/30min100.png) The virtual learning environment will stay up for 60 minutes, however, **this lab should only take about 30 minutes** to complete. When your learning environment expires, your work will not be saved. If you haven't completed the lab, you can simply restart it.
