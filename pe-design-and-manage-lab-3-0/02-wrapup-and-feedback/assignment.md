In this lab, you:
 - Added a base profile to existing roles.
 - Used Puppet Development Kit (PDK) to create a base profile class.
 - Added a class to the base profile to show a dynamic, role-specific login message based on information retrieved from trusted facts.
 - Logged into nodes that have different roles to see the dynamic login message.
