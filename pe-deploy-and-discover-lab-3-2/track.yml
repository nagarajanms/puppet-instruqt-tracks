title: Establish Server Roles by Reinstalling Agents with Trusted Facts
teaser: Purge the agent from your nodes and reinstall it with Puppet's trusted facts.
description: |-
  **What you'll learn**

  In this, lab, you'll purge the Puppet agent from your nodes, and then reinstall the agent on each node to include Puppet's pp_role and pp_datacenter trusted facts.

  Because trusted facts are extracted from the agent certificate, the data is immutable, providing a higher level of security for your nodes. You can use the data from facts to classify (group) nodes so that you can get configuration and performance data for a specific group of nodes.
