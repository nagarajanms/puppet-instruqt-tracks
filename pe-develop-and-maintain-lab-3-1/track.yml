  This lab demonstrates using Hiera and class parameters to abstract the port value and docroot values in the apache profile.

  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you will:
  - Refactor the apache profile to introduce a `$port` class parameter of data type `Integer`.
  - Add a common setting for all nodes running Apache HTTP Server to use the same docroot via `common.yaml` and Hiera.
  - Deploy your code to production.
