In this lab, you:
 - Created `apache` and `iis` profile classes that configured web server implementations and added them to role classes.
 - Updated these profiles to use the `apache` module and the `iis` module from Puppet Forge.
 - Added the profiles to existing role classes.
 - Added the `apache` and `iis` modules and their dependencies to the Puppetfile in your control repo.
 - Ran Puppet in no-op mode to simulate a Puppet run across all nodes without actually making changes.
 - After successful testing, ran Puppet again to make sweeping changes — in this case, fast provisioning — across your data center at the snap of a finger.
