You can quickly confirm Bolt is installed correctly by running some basic Bolt commands.

First, show the Bolt version by running this command:
```
bolt --version
```

Then, show the Bolt help message:
```
bolt --help
```

To show all the Bolt commands, run **bolt --help** again.

Bolt also shows help for each of its subcommands. For example, to get help for the **script** command, run:
```
bolt script --help
```

âœ… **Result:** If Bolt is installed correctly, you'll see the output on the command line.

To continue, click **Check**.
