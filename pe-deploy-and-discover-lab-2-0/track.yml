title: Install Puppet Agents
teaser: Learn how to install agents from both the command line and the PE console.
description: |-
  **What you'll learn**

  In this lab, you'll install the Puppet agent via two different methods: locally by using the agent installation script and remotely from the PE console. Both methods enable you to install agents at scale.

  Installing agents at scale prepares your infrastructure to quickly and automatically scale up the number of nodes managed and configured as Puppet manifests are written and deployed to the primary Puppet server.


  **Prerequisites**

  None
