    Puppet Enterprise (PE) ships with several pre-built tasks and plans that you can run from both the command line and the PE Console.

    In this lab, you will run tasks that accomplish the following:

    - Reboot a node that's managed by Puppet.
    - Gather facts on a specific node.
    - Stop and start the **time** service.
    - Gather system information about the PuppetDB PostgreSQL installation.

Run tasks from the command line
========

1. Before you can run a task, you need to know which nodes you can run tasks against. On the **Primary Server** tab, run the following command to reveal the list of nodes to choose from:
    ```
    puppetserver ca list --all
    ```

    üí° Note the `winagent` machine name. You'll use this name when you run your first task.<br><br>

1. Run the `task show` command to see a list of available tasks:
    ```
    puppet task show --all
    ```
    üí° Notice the **reboot** task. You'll run this task first.<br><br>

1. Reboot the `winagent` node by running the **reboot** command, replacing `<winagent>` with the actual name of the node that appeared in the output for step 1:
    ```
    puppet task run reboot --nodes <winagent>
    ```
    üîÄ Switch to the **Windows Agent 1** tab and notice that the node is now disconnected. <br><br>

1. When you see the **Reconnect** button (after approximately 30 seconds), click it to reconnect to the **Windows Agent 1** node and complete the reboot. ![reconnect button](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/reconnect-100.png)

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** The Windows node has rebooted.

    üîÄ Switch to the **Primary Server** tab.<br><br>
1. Run the following command to return facts about the Windows node. Remember to replace `<winagent>` with the name of the Windows node used earlier:
    ```
    puppet task run facts --nodes <winagent>
    ```
1. Scroll through the output and observe the returned facts from your Windows node, including IP address, OS, kernel, and uptime. Note that the uptime is changed by the reboot.

‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** Congratulations! You ran a task from the command line to reboot and return facts about the Windows node. Continue below to learn how to run a task from the PE console.

Run tasks from the PE console
========

üîÄ Switch to the **PE Console** tab.

1. Login with username `admin` and password `puppetlabs`.
2. Navigate to the **Tasks** page (**Orchestration** > **Tasks**).
3. Notice that the two previous tasks that you ran on the command line are shown. These tasks have been recorded by the console.
4. In the upper-right corner, click **Run a task**. ![run a task button](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/run-a-task.png)
5. From the **Code environment** list, select `development`.
6. In the **Task** field, scroll and select `service`.
7. In the **Task parameters** section, enter the following:
    - For **action**, choose **stop**
    - For **name**, enter `w32time`<br><br>
8. In the **Select targets** section, from the **Select a target type** list, select **Node group**.
1. In the **Choose a node group** field, choose **Development environment (development)** and then click **Select**.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Result:** The name of your Windows node populates in the space below.

    üîÄ Switch to the Windows Agent 1 tab.<br><br>

1. Open a PowerShell window and run the following command:
    ```
    Get-Service -Name "w32time"
    ```
    üí° In the terminal output, under the **Status** header, notice that the node is **Running**.

    üîÄ Switch to the **PE Consoler** tab.<br><br>

11. Click **Run task**. When the task run is complete, the page refreshes to show the task **Status** as **Stopped**. ![PE console task status stopped](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/status-stopped.png)

    üîÄ Switch to the **Windows Agent 1** tab.<br><br>

12. Run the PowerShell command again. Notice that the Status output in the terminal indicates **Stopped**.

    üîÄ Switch to the **PE Console** tab.<br><br>

13. In the upper-right corner, click **Run again** > **All nodes**.
14. In the **action parameter** list, select **start** and then click **Run task**.
15. After the task completes, the page refreshes to show the task status as **Started**. ![PE console task status started](https://storage.googleapis.com/instruqt-images/status-started.png)

    üîÄ Switch to the **Windows Agent 1** tab.<br><br>

1. Run the PowerShell command again. The service is now started.

    üîÄ Switch to the **PE Console** tab.<br><br>
16. Go back to the **Tasks** page (**Orchestration** > **Tasks**) and click **Run a task**.
1. Leave **Code environment** set to `production`.
17. In the **Tasks** field, choose `pe_install::get_postgresql_info`.
18. From the **Select a target type** list, select **Node group**.
1. In the **Choose a node group** field, select `PE Master (production)` and then click **Select**.
19. The primary Puppet server populates in the space below. Click **Run task**.
20. After the task finishes, notice that the output provides details about the node run at a sysadmin level.

üéà **Congratulations!** In this lab, you ran a task on the Windows node from both the command line and the PE console. You rebooted the Windows node under enforcement, retrieved Windows node facts, stopped and started the **w32time** service, and gathered system information about the PuppetDB PostgreSQL installation.
