In this lab, you:
 - Created a dedicated code deployment user that you used to authenticate to deploy code.
 - Configured Code Manager to authenticate and download your control repo from the Git server.
 - Created a feature branch in your control repo from the main branch which enabled you to develop safely without affecting production.
 - Added a module in your Puppetfile on your feature branch to test a code deployment.
 - Deployed code from your feature branch to the primary server to enable you to later test changes on nodes in a separate Puppet environment.
