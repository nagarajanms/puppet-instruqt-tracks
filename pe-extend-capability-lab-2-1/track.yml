  Uh oh! You get an unexpected email from the Dev Team
  From: Dev Team
  Subject: NGINX, Windows and install dir - we have a slight problem...
  Hi SysAdmin,

  Quick heads up: The NGINX Chocolatey package does not allow you to specify a
  complete installation path. The installation directory is always created and named according to the NGINX version, for example: c:\tools\nginx-1.24.1\

  Thanks for working on this and let us know if there is anything else you need.
